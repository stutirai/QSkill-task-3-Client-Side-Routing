# 🗺️ QSkill Task 3 — Client Side Routing

> Internship task submission completed as part of the **QSkill Frontend Development Internship**.

A React application demonstrating client side routing using **react-router-dom**, where multiple pages can be navigated without any full browser refresh.

## 📋 Task Description

> Create client side routing using **react-router-dom**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **React** | Component-based UI |
| **react-router-dom** | Client side routing between multiple pages |
| **Vite** | Fast development server and build tool |

---

## ✨ Features

- Multiple pages — Home, About, Users — navigable without any page reload
- Active link highlighting using `NavLink`
- Dynamic user profile pages using route parameters (`/users/:id`)
- Programmatic navigation using `useNavigate`
- Automatic 404 redirect for unknown routes using a wildcard `*` route

## ⚙️ How It Works — Routing Breakdown

**`BrowserRouter`**
Wraps the entire app in `main.jsx` to enable routing throughout the component tree.

**`Routes` and `Route`**
Define which component renders for each URL path. Each `Route` maps a path to a page component.

**`NavLink`**
Used in the navbar — automatically applies active styling to the link matching the current URL, so the user always knows which page they're on.

**`useNavigate`**
Allows programmatic navigation — for example, clicking a user card navigates to that user's profile page without needing an anchor tag.

**`useParams`**
Reads dynamic segments from the URL. For `/users/1`, `useParams()` returns `{ id: "1" }`, which is used to look up and display the correct user's profile.

**`Navigate`**
Used to redirect — any unknown URL hits the `*` wildcard route and gets redirected to the 404 page automatically.

```javascript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/users" element={<Users />} />
  <Route path="/users/:id" element={<UserProfile />} />
  <Route path="/404" element={<NotFound />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/404" replace />} />
</Routes>
```
